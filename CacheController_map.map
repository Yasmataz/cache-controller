Mapping design into LUTs...
ERROR:MapLib:979 - LUT4 symbol
   "myIcon/U0/U_ICON/U_TDO_MUX/U_CS_MUX/I4.U_MUX16/Mmux_O_4" (output
   signal=myIcon/U0/U_ICON/U_TDO_MUX/U_CS_MUX/I4.U_MUX16/Mmux_O_4) has input
   signal "myIcon/CONTROL0<3>" which will be trimmed. See Section 5 of the Map
   Report File for details about why the input signal will become undriven.
ERROR:MapLib:978 - LUT4 symbol
   "myIcon/U0/U_ICON/U_TDO_MUX/U_CS_MUX/I4.U_MUX16/Mmux_O_4" (output
   signal=myIcon/U0/U_ICON/U_TDO_MUX/U_CS_MUX/I4.U_MUX16/Mmux_O_4) has an
   equation that uses input pin I0, which no longer has a connected signal.
   Please ensure that all the pins used in the equation for this LUT have
   signals that are not trimmed (see Section 5 of the Map Report File for
   details on which signals were trimmed).
