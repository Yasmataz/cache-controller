Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   0

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:MapLib:979 - LUT4 symbol
   "myIcon/U0/U_ICON/U_TDO_MUX/U_CS_MUX/I4.U_MUX16/Mmux_O_4" (output
   signal=myIcon/U0/U_ICON/U_TDO_MUX/U_CS_MUX/I4.U_MUX16/Mmux_O_4) has input
   signal "myIcon/CONTROL0<3>" which will be trimmed. See Section 5 of the Map
   Report File for details about why the input signal will become undriven.
ERROR:MapLib:978 - LUT4 symbol
   "myIcon/U0/U_ICON/U_TDO_MUX/U_CS_MUX/I4.U_MUX16/Mmux_O_4" (output
   signal=myIcon/U0/U_ICON/U_TDO_MUX/U_CS_MUX/I4.U_MUX16/Mmux_O_4) has an
   equation that uses input pin I0, which no longer has a connected signal.
   Please ensure that all the pins used in the equation for this LUT have
   signals that are not trimmed (see Section 5 of the Map Report File for
   details on which signals were trimmed).

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network myIcon/CONTROL0<13> has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 31 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   myIcon/CONTROL0<14>,
   myIcon/CONTROL0<20>,
   myIcon/CONTROL0<15>,
   myIcon/CONTROL0<4>,
   myIcon/CONTROL0<21>
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
  64 block(s) removed
   6 block(s) optimized away
  51 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).
